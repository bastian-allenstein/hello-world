Hi Humans!

I'm first of all a designer, but I also consider myself a (front-end) web developer. My built my first website about 1997 or 1998. HTML and CSS was easy. Later I learnd Flash, Flex Builder and Actionscript. After Apple said they wouldn't allow Flash an iPhones, I quit web design / development for a few years.
In 2016 I started again with wordpress.
Now I want to really get to know HTML5, CCS3 and JavaScript. We'll see where it goes from there.... but still first of all I am and will be a designer (logo design / corporate design, illustrator, print, web design, 3D).

greetings,
Bastian Allenstein
